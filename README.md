[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flindersuni/rpa-Flinders.Foundation.StudentSystem.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flindersuni/rpa-Flinders.Foundation.StudentSystem)

This repository contains a [UiPath][uipath] library project. It is used by the
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) team at [Flinders University][flinders].

It provides common activities used by our projects that target
the [Student Management System][student-management].

## Documentation ##

Documentation on each activity is available in the [wiki][wiki].

## Continuous Integration ##

Commits to branches in this repository automatically trigger a build in
[Travis CI][travisci]. The build script automatically checks the project for
lint errors using the the [rpa-lint][rpa-lint] app developed by the team at
[Flinders University][flinders].

## Acknowledgements ##

The RPA team acknowledges the assistance of [RPA Solutions][rpa-solutions] in
the development of an earlier pre-release version of this library.
